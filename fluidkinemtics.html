        <p><font size="3px"><font color="white">Fluid kinematics is a term from fluid mechanics, usually referring to a mere mathematical description or specification of a flow field, divorced from any account of the forces and conditions that might actually create such a flow. The term fluids includes liquids or gases, but also may refer to materials that behave with fluid-like properties, including crowds of people or large numbers of grains if those are describable approximately under the continuum hypothesis as used in continuum mechanics.</font></font></p>   
        
        <p><font size="3px"><font color="white">Fluid Kinematics is the study of motion of fluid without consideration of the forces which cause the motion. Just like we study the velocity, speed, etc of a car without the care of forces of friction and air drag and others that oppose the motion of the car.</font></font></p>
